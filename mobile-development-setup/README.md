# Setting Up and Testing My Mobile Development Environment

## Objective

Mobile development usually requires more computational resources than web development because of device-specific testing and native integrations. For this reason, I am using the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which simplifies mobile app development and testing on physical devices.

The objective of this task is to properly set up my mobile development environment and confirm that Expo Go runs successfully on my physical device.

## Requirements

To complete this task, I ensured that the following tools were available and properly installed:

* **Node.js (LTS version)**
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as my code editor
* A compatible operating system (**macOS, Linux, or Windows**)
* **Expo Go** installed on my physical mobile device (Android or iOS)

These tools are essential for efficiently completing upcoming React Native mobile development projects.

## Why I Chose Expo Go

Unlike web development, mobile development often relies on device emulators or real devices for testing. Managing multiple emulators for different device models (such as various iPhone and Android versions) can be resource-intensive and difficult to maintain.

I chose **Expo Go** because it provides a cost-effective and flexible way to test React Native applications by allowing me to:

* Run my applications directly on a physical device
* Test on both Android and iOS without setting up heavy emulators
* Instantly preview changes during development

This approach allows me to work efficiently without requiring high-end hardware.

### 3. Installed Expo Go on My Device

* **Android**: I installed Expo Go from the **Google Play Store**
* **iOS**: I installed Expo Go from the **Apple App Store**

---

### 4. Opened the Expo Go Application

After installation, I opened the Expo Go app on my mobile device.

---

### 5. Created or Logged In to My Expo Account

* I created a new Expo account since I did not already have one
* After that, I logged in to enable project access and testing

## Challenges I Faced

During the setup process, I encountered a few minor challenges:

* Initially being unsure which SDK version to select
* Slow download speed from the app store due to network issues
* A short delay during account verification

I resolved these issues by retrying the process and ensuring I had a stable internet connection.

## Conclusion

I successfully set up my mobile development environment using Expo Go on a physical device. This setup allows me to test React Native applications efficiently without relying on resource-heavy emulators. With Expo Go installed and configured, I am now ready to proceed with future mobile development tasks and projects.
